# SessionProvider
*An Essentials framework plugin that provides HTTP sessions by dynamically loading configurable session provider libraries*

This package is an Essentials framework plugin that allows users to configure runtime loaded session providers as assets and order them to handle sessions for http connections. The purpose of this library is to allow overlapping session providers to attach sessions for different purposes and expose endpoints. An example would be OAuth2 sessions alongside Web sessions for normal web applications and OAuth2 api applications.

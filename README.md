# VNLib.Plugins.Sessions 

This folder contains helper libraries for the developing session providers, plugins for managing distributed object caching, and client runtime implementations. 

Each library or plugin library should contain a readme.md file for setup/installation or usage.

#### Builds
Debug build w/ symbols & xml docs, release builds, NuGet packages, and individually packaged source code are available on my [website](https://www.vaughnnugent.com/resources/software). All tar-gzip (.tgz) files will have an associated .sha384 appended checksum of the desired download file.

## License 
Licenses may vary depending on the project. Each project will contain a license file and applicable licensing information in the project's readme.
